        Inputs:              
            network (str) The type of network structure that the community possessses. The 
              simulator can choose between three types: a small-world, undirected Barabasi-Albert 
              graph (BA), a small-world, directed random k-out-degree graph (directed), and 
              a complete network where all agents are connected to each other (complete).
              Default: BA
            
            needs (float) The need for the resource by each agent. The need is a percentage
              of the rate_of_return, and is determined by micro-situational economic and social
              variables, such as family size and availability of resource for living.
              Default: 1
              
            neighborhood_size (float) The number of other agents the average individual is able
              to observe in any given round. Observable agents are called neighbors. In BA networks, 
              the agents' neighborhood sizes are distirbuted with a power law distribution around a 
              mean of 5, while all agents can observe 5 neighbors in the directed network. In the 
              complete network, neighborhood size is irrelevant since all agents are connected.
              Default: 5
            
            prosociality(float) The mean altruistic tendency of the individuals 
              in the community. This parameter is used as the prior for individual social
              norm beliefs.
              Default: 1   
            
            sanction_cost (float) The cost of imposing a sanction on a defector, as a ratio
              of the rate_of_return.
              Default: 0.1
            
            p_interaction(float) The probability of having a social interaction with another
              person during the time period. Social interaction can enhance the agent's 
              sense of belonging and thereby boost affective commitment.
              Default: 0.1
              
            markup (bool) Turns the observation of the results on and off.
              Default: False
        
        Variables:
            network_size (int) The number of agents in the community.
              Default: 50
            
            resource_stock (int) The stock variable of the common resource which all individuals use.
              Default: 100
              
            rate_of_return (float) The rate at which the resource yields returns in 
              one period of time. Depending on the common resource analyzed, this can 
              include the replenishment of a natural resource, the social surplus created 
              by community services, institutions or cultural events, or the network effects 
              that arise from information aggregation in knowledge commons.
              Default: 1
